# Active-Directory-Lab

## Description

This project details how I built an Active Directory home lab environment using VMware. I began by installing Microsoft Server and configuring it to host Active Directory services. Following that, I established a Domain Controller to manage the domain operations. Once the domain was set up, I ran a PowerShell script that generated over 1,000 user accounts in Active Directory. I then logged into several of these newly created accounts on a separate client machine, which was connected to the domain and had internet access. The lab served as a simulation of a corporate network environment. For this setup, I utilized a Microsoft Server 2019 ISO, a Windows 10 Enterprise ISO, VMware, and a PowerShell script.

## Tools and Technologies Utilized

**Active Directory**
- For managing domain services and creating user accounts in a simulated business environment.
**PowerShell**
- To automate the creation of over 1,000 user accounts in Active Directory.
**CMD**
- For additional system commands and configurations during the lab setup.

## Environments Deployed

**VMware**
Virtualization platform for hosting the lab environment.

**Microsoft Server 2019** 

Operating system for running Active Directory and managing the domain.

**Windows 10 (21H2)** 
Client machine used for testing domain connectivity and user logins.
